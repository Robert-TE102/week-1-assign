# week-1-assign

Week 1 assignment.
What Requirements did you achieve?
I think I achieved all the requirements, adding a header, nav and a footer.
Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I don't think so, I'm starting a new thing here and hope that i got the requirements asked.
If so what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I found the whole thing quite a challenge, as doing it from home with numerous amount of distractions is the challenge.

Feedback
I would like feedback on the whole submission and not just a specific part of it, when I added the image through google, i kept trying to position everything onto the image, but couldn't seem to get it to work and was getting very frustrated with myself, I changed the image to a local image, but had the same issue, also tried to add a 2nd image for another section of the website on the same page, but couldn't make it work, a couple of the links under the header goes to the bottom of the page, and at the bottom of the page the 'BUY' and the 'Top of page' both take you back to the top of the page, kept trying to position all the boxes in different places and at different sections, but wasn't able to do that properly either.
I used alot of the Tomato Time for reference, my previous work and Manny's lessons too for reference.
nothing went as well as I'd hoped, I wanted to do much better, but I need alot of time on this to understand it properly.
